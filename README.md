# Musicon
This bot is a project for my Computer Science classes. It is a music bot for discord that lets you play songs and lists of songs in voice channels. I will continue improving the project as the due dates will progress :D

## Running the bot yourself
1. Install node.js and npm if they are not installed already. [node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Pandicon/Musicon.git`, and then `cd` into the repository folder.
    - You can also fork this repository
3. Install all the dependencies using `npm i` or `yarn`
4. Rename `config-template.json` to `config.json` and `info-template.json` to `info.json` and fill in the values
5. Then you can run the bot using `node index.js`
